                        <p> During my time as an undergraduate I researched with Robert Boyd's 
                        nonlinear optics group at the University of Rochester.
                        I joined his group in February 2021 and began computationally exploring the effect of epsilon near 
                        zero (ENZ) materials on Dicke Superradiance. After making several advancements on the superradiance code I got distracted 
                        by a non-local aberration 
                        cancellation experiment. In this experiment, position-momentum entangled photons are created via SPDC. One 
                        photon encounters aberrations, and we correct for the aberrations non-locally by affecting the other photon.
                        I wrote my senior thesis on this experiment.

                        <p>
                         I have am now one year into my MSc research in Dr. Andrew Weiner's group at Purdue University. We are working towards building a QLAN with
                            frequency bin entangled photons. A model for a quantum frequency processor (QFP) was proposed by Hsuan-Hao Lu and 
                            Joseph Lukens (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8902062">1</a>), both alumni of the group. Our vision is a QLAN with QFPs
                            at each node. The main challenge is that the QFPs at different nodes must all be driven by the same 25GHz RF signal with sub ps stability. 
                            I am taking an RF over fiber approach to try to replicate the same RF signal at the distant nodes.

                            from Prof. Tilman Esslinger's ETH Zurich website.

                    <div class="cqed-content">
                        <p> I am currently doing research with Robert Boyd's 
                        nonlinear optics group at the University of Rochester.
                        I am computationally exploring the effect of epsilon near 
                        zero (ENZ) materials on Dicke Superradiance. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                        This research has taken me well beyond my 
                        undergraduate studies. I began by studying the Jaynes-Cummings
                        model and optical Bloch equations. But this was not enough.
                        I have since dug deeper, learning about the density operator
                        master equation under the Born-Markov approximation and open quantum 
                        systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>And yet I have only scratched the surface of CQED. The most interesting 
                        feature of superradiance to me is its application to ultra-narrow linewidth
                        bad-cavity lasers. This is an interest that I plan on pursuing. My research has 
                        also peaked my interest in ultra-cold trapped ions/atoms, quantum information, quantum computing,
                        and gauge theories in QED. I have a lot on my to-do list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will update this page and go much more in depth once I find an easy way to 
                            embed LaTeX in HTML. Also the CQED picture on my homepage was borrowed
                            from Prof. Tilman Esslinger's ETH Zurich website.

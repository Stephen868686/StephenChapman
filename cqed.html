                        <p> I am currently doing research with Robert Boyd's 
                        nonlinear optics group at the University of Rochester.
                        I joined his group in February 2021 and began computationally exploring the effect of epsilon near 
                        zero (ENZ) materials on Dicke Superradiance. To work on the computer simulations I had to catch up on a lot of theory
                        such as the Jaynes-Cummings model and the master equation applied to a two-level system.
                        </p>
                        <p>After making several advancements on the superradiance code I got distracted by a non-local aberration 
                         cancellation experiment. In this experiment, position-momentum entangled photons are created via SPDC. One 
                         photon encounters aberrations and we correct for the aberrations non-locally by affecting the other photon.
                         I am writing my senior thesis on this experiment, and I hope to publish a paper on it soon as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           My time in Prof. Boyd's group has opened my eyes to areas of physics and optics far beyond my undergraduate education.
                            Through this research I have become interested in many different topics including CQED, light matter interactions, 
                            quantum communication, and nonlinear optics.
                        </p>

                            Also the picture for this topic on my homepage was borrowed
                            from Prof. Tilman Esslinger's ETH Zurich website.

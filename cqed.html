                        <p> During my time as an undergraduate I researched with Robert Boyd's 
                        nonlinear optics group at the University of Rochester.
                        I joined his group in February 2021 and began computationally exploring the effect of epsilon near 
                        zero (ENZ) materials on Dicke Superradiance. After making several advancements on the superradiance code I got distracted 
                        by a non-local aberration 
                        cancellation experiment. In this experiment, position-momentum entangled photons are created via SPDC. One 
                        photon encounters aberrations, and we correct for the aberrations non-locally by affecting the other photon.
                        I wrote my senior thesis on this experiment.

                        <p>
                         I have now completed my MSc research in Dr. Andrew Weiner's group at Purdue University. We are working towards building a QLAN with
                            frequency bin entangled photons. A model for a quantum frequency processor (QFP) was proposed by Hsuan-Hao Lu and 
                            Joseph Lukens (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8902062">1</a>), both alumni of the group. Our vision is a QLAN with QFPs
                            at each node. The main challenge is that the QFPs at different nodes must all be driven by the same 20GHz RF signal with sub ps stability. 
                            I achieved this with an RF over fiber technique to transport the GHz signal.

                            I am now starting my professional career at Penn State's Electro-Optic Center. The EO Center is a part of Penn State's Applied 
                            Research Laboratories that focuses on researching optics with DoD applications.

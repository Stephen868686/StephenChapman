                        <p> During my time as an undergraduate I researched with Robert Boyd's 
                        nonlinear optics group at the University of Rochester.
                        I joined his group in February 2021 and began computationally exploring the effect of epsilon near 
                        zero (ENZ) materials on Dicke Superradiance. After making several advancements on the superradiance code I got distracted 
                        by a non-local aberration 
                        cancellation experiment. In this experiment, position-momentum entangled photons are created via SPDC. One 
                        photon encounters aberrations, and we correct for the aberrations non-locally by affecting the other photon.
                        I wrote my senior thesis on this experiment.

                        <p>
                         In Fall 2022 I will begin researching with Dr. Andrew Weiner's group at Purdue Unviersity. I plan to 
                         research quantum integrated photonics including quantum frequency combs.

                            Also the picture for this topic on my homepage was borrowed
                            from Prof. Tilman Esslinger's ETH Zurich website.

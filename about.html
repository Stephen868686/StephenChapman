                        <h1>Hi, my name is Stephen Chapman</h1>
                        <p>
                            I am an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester. I am double majoring in Physics
                            and Optics. I plan to get a graduate degree in a related field so that I can work in some super cool 
                            lab or something like that. When I'm not studying, I enjoy tennis, soccer, chess, and rock climbing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I created this website because I was supposed to be studying for the Physics GRE subject test,
                            but I despise that test and didn't want to study for it. This website is a product of procrastination.
                            I had no idea how to make a website, but I've seen a bunch of professors' websites made in HTML that look 
                            horrible. I wanted my website to look halfway decent so I went all in with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.
                            YouTube tutorials helped me out a lot. I hope you are impressed because this took me a whole weekend to make.
                        </p>
                        <p>
